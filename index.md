## Who is Mohammed?

Mohammed is a student currently studying in a well known Arabic University, Aljamea tus Saifiyah. All good in him is from here. The most uncommon thing about him is that he is sole believer of what Bill Gates have quoted  "I will always choose a **lazy** person to do a **difficult job** because a **lazy person** will find an **easy** way to do it."  So, if you have some work that's not being done, you know the right person for it.
